# AWS_iot_IIIT

We are using linkit one as micro-controller.

This code publishes message to topic='dhairya' on aws iot core
you have to store data recevied to dyanamodb or any other database

# JSON_to_TOPIC
This code sends data to aws iot topic="dhairya" in json format, and now we are able to get that data on dynamoDB.
we now have to retrive data from data base and show on a website

# Work to do
1. We have to take real data from real sensors like gps, temperature, gas etc and send them to an AWS database.
2. In aws we have to set period of data accteptance to be set from custom website.
3. we have to built a custom website.
4. we will use node js and dyanamo db for website.
